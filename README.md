## Introduction

The **News Article Summarizer** is a Python-based application that allows users to input the URL of any news article and generates a concise summary along with sentiment analysis. Itâ€™s designed to help users quickly grasp the key points of an article and understand its toneâ€”whether positive, negative, or neutral.

The project leverages several Python libraries, including `nltk`, `TextBlob`, and `newspaper3k`, to process and analyze the article's content. The user-friendly interface is built using `tkinter`, allowing for a seamless experience.

## Features

- **Article Extraction**: Automatically parses the article content from a URL using the `newspaper3k` library.
- **Summarization**: Condenses the article to its key points using NLP techniques.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the article using `TextBlob`.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with `tkinter` for ease of use.
- **Multi-Output**: Displays the articleâ€™s title, authors, publication date, summary, and sentiment analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core language
- **tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface
- **nltk**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis
- **newspaper3k**: For extracting news articles from web pages

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-article-summarizer.git
cd news-article-summarizer
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the application:
```bash
python news_article_summarizer.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Input URL**: The user enters the URL of the news article they want summarized.
2. **Article Parsing**: The `newspaper3k` library scrapes the content of the article from the URL.
3. **Summarization**: The article is summarized using NLP techniques.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: The `TextBlob` library determines the polarity of the article, indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
5. **Output**: The summarized content, along with key details such as the title, author(s), publication date, and sentiment analysis, is displayed in the GUI.

## Usage

1. Open the application by running the command:
   ```bash
   python news_article_summarizer.py
   ```
2. Enter the URL of a news article into the text field.
3. Click the **"Summarize"** button.
4. The summarized content will be displayed, including:
   - **Title**
   - **Authors**
   - **Publication Date**
   - **Summary**
   - **Sentiment Analysis**
